        <h2>Yeouido Park cherry-blossoms</h2>
        <p>Yeouido Park is a beautiful park located on Yeouido Island in Seoul. The park is divided into four different sections: the Traditional Korean Forest, Grass Square, Culture Square, and Nature’s Ecosystem Forest. Yeouido Park is definitely the best place to see cherry blossom during the spring season in Seoul. During the springtime, the Yeouido Spring Flower Festival is also held on Yeouiseo-ro Road (Yunjung-no). If you plan to visit, it’s best to check online the dates of the festival beforehand. That’s also probably the best time to visit the park.</p>
